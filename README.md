# Evil Hangman - Free Crash Course on Javascript
Based on [Nifty Assignment](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2011/schwarz-evil-hangman/)

##Overview
Our Evil Hangman crash course provides an intro to Javascript by building a humorous variant of the classic Hangman game. The course will give participants an intro to programming and the core features of the Javascript programming language. 

Evil Hangman is played in exactly the same way as the original game; in fact, the player should have no idea that they're not playing the original game. The difference, however, is that the computer is actually cheating to make the game as hard as possible for the player: it doesn't actually settle on a word until the very end of the game, but tries to keep the player in the dark for as long as possible. Instead of picking a word at the very beginning a la regular hangman, it chooses a word but readily changes to a different word if the player starts guessing letters correctly.

Note that this course focuses specifically on Javascript and only lightly skims over HTML, CSS, and other related concepts. Some prior familiarity with HTML and CSS would be helpful but isn't required.

##Outcomes
By the end of the course, participants will have their own version of Evil Hangman and a basic understanding of the power of programming in Javascript. Oh, and an amazing prank for your favorite word nerd.
